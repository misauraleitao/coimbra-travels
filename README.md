Coimbra Travels is a fully responsive application targeting Coimbra city travellers allowing them to view and create posts of various places in the city.
This application will be useful to the users as they can plan their itinerary to their liking, and/or they can add places that they have visited that are not yet listed in the app so that other users can also plan ahead.

# Web Design

I wanted the main theme to be dark with an old feel, as Coimbra is one of the oldest cities in the country with a lot of dark and
medieval stories and look. 
I opted for a black background with a type of typo caligraphy to infuse that feel and aesthetic.
I also made sure the carousel images were black and white and were all images of old and historical buildings.
For the buttons I kept their usual black colour unless if it was a "danger" type button like for example the delete action where I have made them 
red so that they stand out to the user.
The Cards are simple and I have decided to display three in a row as it makes the images bigger and easier to see and the card only displays the catagory,
location, date and it has a title of the place. If users wish to view more they can simply click the caret icon to view its description. This helps the overall
look of the website and makes it more interactive.

# Wireframes

All wireframes were made by hand on paper.

# Deployment to Heroku


Here are the steps that I took to deploy my application to Heroku:

1. First of all, you must `register/login` to deploy the application. I am already a member therefore I simply logged in my details and clicked the button to log in.

2. Onced logged in, it took me straight to my apps page and I clicked create new app which took me to the page displayed on the picture bellow. 
It required me to come up with a unique name for my app, for which I named `coimbra-travels`(please note app names should contain lowercase and no spaces) which was available.
I then selected the region section dropdown of `europe` as that is where I am located. I then proceeded to click the `Create app` button to create my application.

3. Now in order to connect our app we can choose from one of a few options like, we could connect it through the use of the `Heroku CLI`. However, for this project I chose to simplify the process by setting up an `Automatic Deployment` from my `GitHub Repository`. So, I click the section highlighted in the picture (`connect to GitHub`). I then make sure that I type in my `repository name` correctly and connect to the repo displayed under that.

4. To avoid application errors, as I have hidden variables and Heroku will not be able to read them I click to the settings page on the nav bar above and I scroll down to `Reveal Config Vars`. I then writen my config vars to Heroku in a secured maner.(making sure to not include any quotes for the key or value).

5. Once we have completed the `Config Vars` we will hide them and go back to the `Deploy` tab, but before I deployed it I made sure to push some files first (`Procfile/requirements.txt`) and I then headed back to the Heroku.


6. I now know that I can safely `Enable Automatic Deployment`, as everything should now be available on my repository.


7. After clicking the enable button I can now go down to `manual deploy` section and click `deploy branch`.

8. Heroku will now receive the code from `GitHub` and start building the app using my required packages. After I waited for my app to build I then seen a message displayed `Your app was successfully deployed` and a link button beneath displaying `View`.

<img src="static/images/deployment-images/Screenshot (9).png" alt="screenshot" width="700" height="350">

9. After clicking that I know that my application has been deployed and I can view it. As of now, any coded pushed to GitHub will now automaticly add to my deployed application.

## Testing Manually

I have made sure I went through the measurements of self testing this web app on the following:

- google chrome: no issues found and web page is fully responsive and working.
- google dev tools: all pages are responsive and all links, buttons and forms work correctly. I tested this on all devices available on dev tools.
- safari (iphone x): all working and responsive I am able to create an account, edit, create and delete posts aswel as using the search bar.
- dell laptop: all working- this was the laptop I have used for my project so results were consistent.
- microsoft edge: all working fine.
- opera: all working fine.

### To test the web app theese were the steps :

1. nagivate to the web page and scroll to see content. click on the content and see the displayed description, making sure there are no buttons for me to see as I have not
created an account.
2. trying out the search bar to see if it picks up the keywords and seeing if the reset function is available and works.
3. Proceed to Creating an account. Checking all validators seeing if they work.
4. I can see it took me straight to the profile page and flash messages are appearing I will check these as they appear for other functions on the web page too.
5. Checking to see if there are more options on the nav bar, if admin there should also be a manage category link. 
6. Create a new place, checking to see all validators, dropdown picker and calendar all work fine.
7. Return to the home page automatically seeing my post on there.
8. Clicked the post and checking if the edit, delete buttons work.
9. Log out.
10. Log in.
11. Constantly checking the database and seeing that things are being added to it.
